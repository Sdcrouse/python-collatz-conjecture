# Python Collatz Conjecture Project

This is a simple Python project that I made to test out the Collatz Conjecture. It takes user input and generates a sequence of numbers that always ends with 1.

The Collatz Conjecture states that for any positive integer, the following process will always end at 1:

1. If the number is even, divide it by 2
2. If the number is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1
3. Repeat Steps 1 and 2

## Prerequisites

This project was made with Python 3.13.2 (the latest version as of March 2025). You can [download the latest version here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

## Usage

To run this app, run these commands in the command line:

1. `cd python-collatz-conjecture`
2. `python ./src/collatz/main.py`

Or, alternatively, `cd` into `/python-collatz-conjecture/src/collatz/` and run `python main.py`.

Either way, follow the prompts and have fun!
